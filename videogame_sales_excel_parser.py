#For each line in the file...
for line in file:
    
    #...split that line into a row by the commas.
    #We can now get each individual piece of data for the row by indexing
    #   it with row[#]
    row = line.split(",")
    
    ##1. Count the number of Role-Playing games â€“ This is the one I completed for you as an example
    if row[3] == "Role-Playing":
        rpgCount += 1


    ##2. Count the number of NES games on the list
        #Hint: row[3] gives us the genre. Which row[?] gives us the platform?
        #How would we compare that platform to the string NES?
    if row[1] == "NES":
        NESCount += 1
        


    ##3. Count the number of PS3 games published by Take-Two Interactive in the file
        #Hint: Now you need to check both the platform AND the publisher
    if row[1] == "PS3"  and row[4] == "Take-Two Interactive":
        PS3_TakeTwo += 1


    ##4. Count the number of PS3 games in the Action genre published by Take-Two Interactive in the file
        #Similar to the last one, but now we also need to check the genre, for 3 checks total
    if row[1] == "PS3" and row[3] == "Action" and row[4] == "Take-Two Interactive":
        PS3_Action_TakeTwo += 1


    ##5. Determine the name and japan-based sales amount of the game that sold the most in Japan
        #Hint: On D2L, there is a FileParseExample that also parses a CSV.
        #   #4 on that is very similar to this.
    if float(row[7]) > Japan_Num1_Sales:
           Japan_Num1_Sales = float(row[7])
           Japan_Num1_Game = row[0]

        
    ##6. Detemine the name and global sales amount of the highest selling (globally) Puzzle game
        #Hint: This one is closer to #5 or #6 in FileParseExample
    if row[3] == "Puzzle":

        if float(row[9]) > Globe_Sales:
            Globe_Sales = float(row[9])
            Globe_Puzzle_Fav = (row[0])



    ##7. Determine the name and global sales amount for the highest selling Sports game that's not on the Wii 
        #Hint: Close to #5 in FileParseExample again. Remember that we can check if something is not equal
            #to something else as easily as we can check if it is equal
    if row[1] != "Wii" and row[3] == "Sports" and float(row[9]) > SpoGloSales:
        SpoGloSales = float(row[9])
        SpoGloName = row[0]
                
            


    ##8. Detemine the percentage of games on the list that Nintendo sold
        #Hint: The percentage of games is the number of games that Nintendo sold over the total number of games, times 100
        #   To get the number of games made by Nintendo, check the publisher to see if it's "Nintendo"
        #   To get the total count, just increment a count outside of an if statement
    total_count += 1
    if row[4] == "Nintendo":
        Nin_Total += 1
    NinSoldPerc = (Nin_Total/total_count) * 100
    NinSoldPerc = format(NinSoldPerc,".2f")

  


    ##9. Print the names of ALL games on the files published by LEGO Media
        #Hint: In the variables section before the loop, create an empty list
        #      Here, if the publisher is "LEGO Media", append the name (index 0) of the game to the list
        #      Where you print your variables, printing len(listName) will give you the number of items in the list,
        #           and printing listname will give you the names
    if row[4] == "LEGO Media":
        gameList.append(row[0])
    
          
 
    ##10. Print the names of all games with at least 10 million global sales
        #Hint: Very similar to #9, but check if the Global Sales column is greater than or equal to 20
    if float(row[9]) >= 20:
        highestGameSales.append(row[0])

        
    ##11. Determine the oldest game in the file.  If there's a tie for the oldest game (there is), print out ALL of the tying games' names and how many there are.
        #Hint: This is a tough problem. First find the year and convert it to an integer.
        #   Now, there are 3 possible situations:
        #       1. The year is the oldest (lowest) year we've seen
        #       2. The year is equal to the oldest (lowest) year we've seen
        #       3. The year is greater than the oldest (lowest) year we've seen
        #
        #   For possibility 3, we don't care about this because we are looking for the lowest year
        #   For possibility 2, there is a tie for the oldest game, so we just need to add the name of
        #       the new game to the list of games
        #   For possibility 1, we have found a new oldest game, so we need to do a couple of things:
        #           1. Update the year stored as the lowest year to the new year
        #           2. Clear the list of names (set it back to [])
        #           3. Add the name of the new game to the list.
        #
        #      A visual example (Note that our list needs to contains the NAMES, but
        #      here I'm using the years to make it easier to follow!
        #
        #       [1999,1999,1999] <-- We have 3 games with the lowest year, 1999
        #       -->1999          We find a new game with a year of 1999
        #       [1999,1999,1999,1999]  We add that game to the list
        #       --> 1997         We find a new game with year of 1997
        #       [1997]           We make that game the only game in the list, since the others are no longer the oldest game

        #Determine lowest year, giving the oldest game.
        #Add the games with the oldest year to the old list. 

    if int(row[2]) < year:
         year = int(row[2])
         old_list = []
         

    if int(row[2]) == year:
        
        old_list.append(row[0])
